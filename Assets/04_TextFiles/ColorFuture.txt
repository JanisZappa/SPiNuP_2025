2048 % 128 = 16
256 % 16 = 16
16 * 256 = 4096
8  * 256 = 2048


lets say (Color) is 1788 and (MatCap) is 3
then I write into (R) = (Color) % 256 = 1788 - (6 * 256 = 1536) = 252
         and into (G) = (6 * 16 = MatCapOffset) + (MatCap) = 99


and I read 
	(R) = 252 and (G) = 99
then
	colorOffset = (G) / 16 = 6
	(Color)  = 256 * colorOffset + (R) = 1788
	(MatCap) = (G) % 16 = 99 - 96 = 3
	
	
	
	
(B) should be the shadowmask
